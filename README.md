# Under Construction -- Coming soon!

# TetGAN

TetGAN is a convolutional neural network for tetrahedral mesh generation. Our framework synthesizes new tetrahedral meshes, and edits existing tetrahedral meshes through latent-space manipulations

- clone this repo
- install dependencies
### Data
- get preprocessed data (or process it yourself)
### Usage
- run pretrained models (or train it yourself)
- run inference
- latent operations
- evalution
